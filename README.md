# ai-llm-examples
This is a collection of examples demonstrating how to use the Ollama LLM (Language Model) for various tasks. The examples cover a range of topics, including stock analysis, data processing, and more.
The goal is to provide practical use cases for leveraging the capabilities of the LLM in different scenarios, and learning how to integrate it into your projects.
## Getting Started
To get started, you'll need to have Ollama installed and running on your system. You can find instructions on how to install Ollama on various platforms in the official documentation.
Once you have Ollama set up, you can run the examples by following the instructions below.
## Running the Examples
To run the examples, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After installing the dependencies, you can run the examples by executing the following command:
```
python <example_name>/main.py
```
Replace `<example_name>` with the directory name of the example you want to run.
